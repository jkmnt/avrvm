'hello world' in avrvm

host_hello.c - host code, compiled by gcc (mingw)
Few host functions are exported to script: putc, sleep and a function to get a next sequence number
I/O register 0 is updated with last pressed key value.

script_hello.c - script code, compiled with avr-gcc for atmega88 machine
Script uses host-provided putc for helloworlding and sleep for sleeping.
Script also reads keyboard input from I/O register 0 and terminates on 'Q' press.

Few things to note in a host code:
* address wrapping in flash reader, specific for flash size of the emulated machine.
* sram size equals to the size of machine sram, since binaries produced by avr-gcc include startup routine initializing stack pointer to the last sram address.
* arguments for host functions are unpacked according to the avr-gcc's call convention via helpers
